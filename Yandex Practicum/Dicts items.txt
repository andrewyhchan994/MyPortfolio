for loop through dictionary goes through keys

use mydict.items()

and for key, item in mydict.items()

Example:
for person, points in game_scores.items(): # person -> key, points -> value
    total_points = sum(points) # the sum() function will return the sum of the points list
    print(f'{person} - {total_points}') # print the total points for each person
