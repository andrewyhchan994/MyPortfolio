Codenames: A, S, M
------------------
17 August 2021: Day 2 
M: 2 submissions
A: 1 submission
Note: A used XGBRegressor with K-fold Cross validation
------------------
18 August 2021: Day 3
A:1 submission
Note: A improved parameters of XGBRegressor
------------------
19 August 2021: Day 4 
A:1 submission
Note: did not improve, dropped 11 outliers
------------------
20 August 2021: Day 5
A:1 submission
Note: did not improve, dropped 5 outliers
------------------
21 August 2021: Day 6
A:1 submission
Note: did not improve, used xgb train without tuning (side-note, felt more computational-intensive than xgbregressor)
------------------
22 August 2021: Day 7
A: 3 submissions
Note: did not improve, and although checked submissions were different data, scores stayed the same
------------------
23 August 2021:Day 8
M: 2 submissions
A: 1 submission
Note: A used LGBMRegressor, didn't improve score, no feature engineering yet
-------------------
24 August 2021: Day 9 
0 submissions
Note: working on hyperparameter grid search, feature engineering, and trying out/learning NN
--------------------
25 August 2021: Day 10
A: 9 submissions
Note: worked on xgb regressor and tuning hyperparams; inflated numbers, needed to find source of error, also worked on LGBM early, w/ feature selection
----------------------
26 August 2021: Day 11
M:1 submission
A: 1 submission
Note: ensemble 0.7 xgb, 0.3 lightgbm, did not improve score
---------------------
27 August 2021: Day 12
A: 2 submissions
Note: best solution so far: remove standardization, use ordinal encoding, use optimal xgbreg params
	- possible overfitting, public rmse much higher than rmse derived from validation data
---------------------
28 August 2021: Day 13
M: 5 submissions
---------------------
29 August 2021: Day 14
M: 1 submission
Note: included numerical scaling (minmax)
---------------------
30 August 2021: Day 15
A: 6 submissions, Improved score
Note: added Numerical transformations into pipeline. Encountered error with the input having feature names, possibly being converted to np.array in pipeline. Preprocessed data using columntransformer outside of sklearn's pipeline. 
-----------------------
31 August 2021: Day 16 Final day
A: 2 submissions
Note: Tried Bayes search CV
