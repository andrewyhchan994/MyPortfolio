INSTRUCTIONS:
You are given two arrays and an index.

Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.

Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.

Return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.
------------------------------------------------
function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {
  let newArr = []; //instructions say keep input arrays the same
  let tempArr = [...arr2];
  newArr.push(...tempArr.splice(0, n)); // when using newarr.push(tempArr.splice(0, n)) -> the arrays were nested
  newArr.push(...arr1);
  newArr.push(...tempArr); //when using newarr.push(tempArr) -> the arrays were nested
  console.log(newArr);

  return newArr;
}

frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1);
