Caesars Cipher
One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
function rot13(str) {
  let baseStr = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
  let newArr = [...baseStr];
  let newStr = "";

  let newIndex = 0;

  for (let i in str){
    if (!newArr.includes(str[i])){
      newStr += str[i];
    } else {
      newIndex = newArr.findIndex(item => item == str[i]) + 13;
	// note need to add by 13 instead of 12
	// learned to use findIndex() better -> findIndex(arrayItem => arrayItem == whatYoureLookingFor)
	
      if (newIndex >= 26){
        newIndex -= 26;
      }
      newStr += newArr[newIndex];
      newIndex = 0;
    }
  }
  console.log(newStr);
  return newStr;

}

rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC");
